# Restaurant-Recommendation-System


**Introduction:**

• Developed a system to recommend restaurants using customer preference considering cuisine, cost, reviews, ratings with a publicly available dataset on Kaggle from an Indian multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company for the city of Bangalore
• Preprocessed and enriched 4000+ restaurant data with 25+ columns to understand factors impacting ratings, common value-based segment clusters, and built extra tree regressor 0.94 R2 Score, low RMSE and MAE scores to predict ratings for newly launched restaurants

**Goal:**

Based on above EDA insights we want to further breakdown the analysis goals as follows:
• Goal 1: Understand what factors impact Rating of a restaurant
• Goal 2: Identify and cluster restaurants based on common attributes and see trends
• Goal 3: Predicting new restaurant rating depending on input parameters
• Goal 4: Building recommendation system to suggest restaurant based on customer preference.

**Dataset summary**
1) Dataset provided consisted of ~56K Restaurants across the city of Bangalore. 
2) 21 columns with combination of Categorical and Numerical features. 
3) Columns: Restaurant ID, Name, Geo Location Columns, Cuisines, Average meal price, Currency, Rating etc
